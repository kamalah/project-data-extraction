# Project: API and Web Data Scraping

## Chocolate

I used the US Food and Drug Administration API to extract Nutrition Facts for Chocolate!

## Using the US FDA API
I tested the json returns of the API to determine how best to access the details that I wanted to extract. I found that the details of the returned items was included in the foods list and was able to further extract items from there.

## Low Sugar Chocolate
A concern that a lot of people have now, is to reduce the sugar in their diet. I created additional columns with the grams of Total Sugar in each chocolate item, sorted by it and then captured the 1000 chocolates with the least sugar to save into my csv file.
